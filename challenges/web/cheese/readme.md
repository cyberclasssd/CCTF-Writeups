## Problem
Mouze wants cheeze. You have a mission. (We are given a website with a login box.)
## Solution
If we enter a random password into the login box, we are redirected to a page that frankly isn't too helpful.

After some intense staring at this page, we see that the URL says "notsuccess.html," which looks fishy. We change /notsuccess.html into /success.html and hit enter. We get the page with the flag.
