## Solution
The message is encrypted with a caesar cipher. We can brute force the cipher using a caesar cipher decryptor, such as [this one](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher). We get:
```
Once upon a time, a chicken on a farm decides to go on a journey. After several long and tiring months, the chicken finally sees her salad and a flag: cctf{notthesharpestknifeincaesar}
```
Flag: `cctf{notthesharpestknifeincaesar}`
