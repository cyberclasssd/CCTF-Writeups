## Solution
This is a vigenere cipher. We can decrypt it using an online tool, such as [this one](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver).
We get:
```
The chicken lifts her head. Suddenly, she sees many many salads. They are all the salads she has lost in her past lives. The chicken sheds a tear of joy and goes to collect her flag: cctf{ihavemoresaladsthanyou}
```

Flag: `cctf{ihavemoresaladsthanyou}`
