# 64
* **Category:** Crypto
* **Points:** 225
## Problem
Apparently encoding something too many times doesn't make it any more secure. Who could've guessed.

## Solution
The given file is encrypted using base64 many times. Writing a simple bash script or manually base64 decrypting it eventually results in the flag.

Flag: `cctf{base64_twenty_times}`
