```
dear diary, today i went to subway to buy a sandwich.
i really wanted to get a beef sandwich because you are what you eat and eating a beef sandwich would obvious make me really beefy and buff and i wanna be beefy and buff.
but also the other day i had to go to the library and i read a book about foxes and turns out foxes are flowers. but they're not.
i also went to the zoo and got an x-ray because i'm a dinosaur. and they want to collect my fossils. 
anyways turns out they had roast beef sandwiches! 
flag: cctf{roastbeefsandwich}
```

Flag: `CCTF{ROASTBEEFSANDWICH}`
