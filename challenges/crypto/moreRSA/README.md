## Problem
Last time the modulus was too small. We made it bigger this time. Hopefully its a bit more secure.
## Solution
Calculating the Euler Totient here is slightly different but still an easy problem. One could write a script to multiply the primes to get the Euler Totient or simply take the Totient directly off of Alpertron.
