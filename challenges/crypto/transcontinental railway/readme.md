## Problem
I'm trying to build a railroad here and I found this message on the golden spike. Can you help me find the flag?
```
CETOHCWLEOGLS}T{CMTEDUFOHR
```
## Solution
The cipher used is the rail fence cipher. To decrypt, we can use [this tool](https://planetcalc.com/6947/), which brute forces the number of rails. The flag is decrypted with 4 rails!

Flag: `CCTF{WELCOMETOTHEGOLDRUSH}`
